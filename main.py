# Goal: Create a controller to allow a bunch of garlic in an isolated space to turn black over the course of 4-8 weeks

#TODO:
# Track temperature:  2-3 probes
#   Should keep around 60-70 C
# Track humidity
#   Should keep around 85%
# Control a fan for convection
# Control a heater - Nichrome or power resistors?
# Optional: Some device to increase humidity
